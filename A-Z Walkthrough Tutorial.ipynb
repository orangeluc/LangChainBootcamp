    "In LangChain, models are at the heart of the framework, enabling the integration and manipulation of large language models (LLMs) to fit specific application needs. Here, we explore how to initialize and use models with LangChain wrappers. These wrappers simplify the interaction with different LLMs, providing a unified interface to enhance usability and flexibility. We'll demonstrate using OpenAI's models as an example, illustrating both a standard LLM and Chat model."

A person whose profession is singing is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art songs or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Greek music, Japanese music, and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal, and popular music styles such as pop, rock, and electronic dance music.\\nSinging can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, as part of a ritual, during music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.\\n\\nPage: Scat singing\\nSummary: Originating in vocal jazz, scat singing or scatting is vocal improvisation with wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or without words at all. In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice solely as an instrument rather than a speaking medium. This is different from vocalese, which uses recognizable lyrics that are sung to pre-existing instrumental solos.\\n\\nPage: Bathroom singing\\nSummary: Bathroom singing, also known as singing in the bathroom, singing in the bath, or singing in the shower, is a widespread phenomenon. \\nMany people sing in the bathroom because the hard wall surfaces, often tiles or wooden panels, and lack of soft furnishings, create an aurally pleasing acoustic environment.'), (ToolAgentAction(tool='wikipedia', tool_input='skiing', log='\\nInvoking: `wikipedia` with `skiing`\\n\\n\\n', message_log=[AIMessageChunk(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'index': 0, 'id': 'call_gHA0oOxo5JII6Xc3x7r02itU', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"__arg1\":\"skiing\"}', 'name': 'wikipedia'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'tool_calls'}, id='run-7c8a93a5-f7c9-4777-aa8b-3040533124d8', tool_calls=[{'name': 'wikipedia', 'args': {'__arg1': 'skiing'}, 'id': 'call_gHA0oOxo5JII6Xc3x7r02itU'}], tool_call_chunks=[{'name': 'wikipedia', 'args': '{\"__arg1\":\"skiing\"}', 'id': 'call_gHA0oOxo5JII6Xc3x7r02itU', 'index': 0}])], tool_call_id='call_gHA0oOxo5JII6Xc3x7r02itU'), 'Page: Skiing\\nSummary: Skiing is the use of skis to glide on snow. Variations of purpose include basic transport, a recreational activity, or a competitive winter sport. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS).\\n\\nPage: Alpine skiing\\nSummary: Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing (cross-country, Telemark, or ski jumping), which use skis with free-heel bindings. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practiced at ski resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants, and ski patrol.\\n\"Off-piste\" skiers—those skiing outside ski area boundaries—may employ snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats to deliver them to the top of a slope. Back-country skiers may use specialized equipment with a free-heel mode, including \\'sticky\\' skins on the bottoms of the skis to stop them sliding backwards during an ascent, then locking the heel and removing the skins for their descent.\\nAlpine ski racing has been held at the Winter Olympics since 1936. A competition corresponding to modern slalom was introduced in Norway at Oslo in 1886.\\n\\nPage: Ski resort\\nSummary: A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area – a mountainous area with pistes (ski trails) and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.\\n\\n')]}\n",
