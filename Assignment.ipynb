    "- Make a PoC which retrieves a popular new paper from ArXiv (see tool integrations for both google (Robin has API key) and arxiv, and potentially Exa (prev. Metaphor)), and use the retrieved web data to explain the concept and make a fun coding challenge. \n",
    "- Make a PoC which makes a coding example that works (use the Python interpreter tool), and then strips code which is then for the tiny hacking participants to fill in.\n",
    "- Make a PoC which uses retrieval to retrieve documents of previous ideas (and fill them with some generated chatgpt stuff for now). This can be super valuable in the future!\n",
